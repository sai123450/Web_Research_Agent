What is a Web Research Agent?
An AI Web Research Agent is a software system that can:

Understand user research queries

Search the web for the latest and relevant content

Scrape and extract structured/unstructured data

Summarize findings and provide explainable reasoning

# Web Research Agent & Design flow:
# Architecture Flow:
Step -1 User Query
Step -2 Query Analyzer - identify Search Goals
Step -3 Search Tool - Get URLs/ Snippets
Step -4 Web Scraper - Extract data from each link
Step -5 Content Analyzer - Evaluate, Relevance, filter, summarize
Step -6 Aggregator - Generate Response
Step -7 Final Answer + Response

# Step-by-Step Agent Decision Logic:
Analyze query intent (factual, recent, opinion, etc.)
Convert query into search terms

Use web search API (e.g., SerpAPI/Bing API or mock tool)
Visit top pages, scrape content (titles, paragraphs, etc.)

Evaluate content relevance using embeddings or keywords
Summarize and explain why each result was selected

# Technical Requirements:
Language: Python
AI Model: GPT-3.5/4 or Claude (via LangChain or direct API)
Search API: Bing Search / SerpAPI / Google Programmable Search
Scraper: BeautifulSoup + requests / Playwright
Embedding: OpenAI Embeddings or SentenceTransformer
Vector Search (optional): FAISS for similarity scoring
Summarization: GPT-based or BART/T5 model

# Project Description:
The WebResearchAgent is a modular, AI-powered assistant designed to:
Understand complex user queries
Simulate a web search (or plug into real APIs)
Scrape page content (mocked or real)
Summarize the findings
Explain why each result is relevant (explainable AI)
1. Understands a user's query
2. Searches the web (mocked)
3. Scrapes page content (mocked)
4. Summarizes each page
5. Explains why it's relevant to the user

# Libraries Used:
requests - To fetch HTML pages
BeautifulSoup - HTML Parsing
OpenAi - For LLM-powered summarization and reasoning simulated

# if needed installation libraries
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openai

# Here program implementing write a code each step by step
Step -1: Mock web search function
Here taking a URL links and simulate a search engine returning given links for a query.

Step -2: Mock web scraper
In a real app, this would fetch actual HTML using requests.get() and parse it with BeautifulSoup.

Step -3: Content Analyzer
Creates a simple summary (first 100 chars)
Generates an explanation of why the content is relevant to the query.

Step -4: Web research agent function
Central logic loop:
Searches
Scrapes
Analyzes
Stores structured results.

Step -5: Run a sample query
Step -6: Display final output
Prints:
 URL
 Summary
 Explanation of relevance.
 The AI Web Research Agent is a modular, intelligent system that simulates how an agentic AI might perform online research.
